            <!-- this will need to be altered with our own declaration -->

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
               publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
               image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
               (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy
               (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published
               between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
               restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic
               transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural
               encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
               Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January
               2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we
               respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original
               source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
               assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature
               (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then
               their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide
               variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the
               period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although
               there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and
               sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling
               reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic
               encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and
               Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for
               accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be
               redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters
               marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per
               text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these
               processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good,
               some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.
               Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been
               looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
               TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
               mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters
               represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML
               (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  web site</ref>.</p>

               offers of grace refused, beyng brought into greate miserie (by Sir Henry Sidney the
               Lorde Deputies daily instigation) and seyng hym self vtterly forsaken bothe of God
                  <pb facs="BL072.jpg"/> and man, at last moued through a desperate and condemned
               conscience, confessing his folly, manifesteth to the whole world, his croked nature,
               complaineth of his fatall destenie (and finally) as it were through a certaine
               coniecture, fore telleth of thynges that shortly shall happen hym. VVherefore behold
               in plaine protractour, a grose and corpulent man, lapped in a mantel ouerwhelmed with
               miserie, beyng in a VVood (an ill fauored Churle) standyng on a Hillocke enclosed
               with a shaking Bogge (his onely refuge in the tyme of trouble) vtteryng moste
               lamentably, with brynishe salte woluishe teares, his life as enseweth.</p>

               before I had ended that portion (euen in the middest thereof) I behelde many
               impedimentes, wonderfull obstacklesse, stoppes, and staies perswadyng the contrarie,
               whiche beeyng replenished with sufficient matter, grounded vpon reason, wisedome
               aduised me, to co<g ref="#tilde">̄</g>sider thereof (least peraduenture) ranging on
               rashely, I might seeme to prosecute an endlesse worke, making a volume, more greater,
               then gratefull, and more painfull, then pleasaunt, (whiche thyng doubtlesse) I
               vtterlie abhorre. Seeyng that praise consistes not, in the quantitie, but rather, in
               the qualitie &amp; grace of a thing doen. And thus I breuiated my former entent, though in
               effect, nothing deminishyng that whiche I promised. For in this discourse, you may

               vnderstande, to what vexations of minde, troubles of bodie, anguishe and
